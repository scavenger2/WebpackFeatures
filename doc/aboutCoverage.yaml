Overview: 
    ? It is NOT a static code analysis tool, it instrument code running like spyOn().andCallThrough() in Jasmine
    ? it generates files under folder "coverage" while instrumenting
    ? Coverage should be applied to your application, not your tests
    ? now you have instrumented code, then run your tests against the instrumented code
    ? Unit-tests and Integration-tests can have coverage check separately, but overall coverage check is also recommended

Installation: 
    - install karma's versitile test coverage plugin like "npm install karma-coverage --save-dev"
    - install istanbul-instrumenter-loader which fixes the issue that karma-coverage returns transpiled code "npm i -D istanbul-instrumenter-loader"
    - install reporter by "npm install karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter --save-dev"

Configuration: 
    ? have to point out which files to instrument & how to run the tests
    ? to help keep tests and source code distinct for Istanbul, separated top-level directories are recommended
    ? pseudo karma.conf.js: |
        {
            files: ['test.webpack.js'],
            plugins: ['karma-jasmine', 'karma-webpack', 'karma-sourcemap-loader', 'karma-coverage'],
            preprocessors: {
                'test.webpack.js': ['webpack', 'sourcemap']
            },
            reporters: ['coverage'],
            webpack: {
                module: {
                    postLoaders: [{
                        test: /\.js$/,
                        exclude: /(test|node_modules)\//,
                        loader: 'istanbul-instrumenter'
                    }]
                }
            },
            webpackServer: {
                noInfo: true  // don't spam the console when running in karma
            },
            coverageReporter: {
                type: 'html',  //produces a html document after code is run
                dir: 'coverage/' //path to create html doc
            }
        }
    ? pseudo test.webpack.js: |
        this will find all of our tests and run them
        var context = require.context('./src', true, /-test\.js$/);
        context.keys().forEach(context);
